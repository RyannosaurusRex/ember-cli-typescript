# ember-cli-typescript

This Ember-CLI plugin uses [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/) to allow you to use TypeScript with your
Ember-CLI project.  The goal is to use TypeScript to transpile your typed TS code to ES2015 code, and then subsequently use
Babel to do the actual transpilation from there to older ES versions.

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-typescript
```

## This add-on is a work in progress and not usable yet.
